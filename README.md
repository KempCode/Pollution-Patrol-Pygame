## Problem
High levels of Disbelief of Scientific fact in NZ. DSSM (Fake org for hackathon) Require application to mitigate this in NZ society.
In this Project we are going to assist the Department of Specific Sciencey Matters, specifically we will
primarily assist the Science Education Department by creating a game for children to help remove
the prevalence of disbelief in scientific fact.

## Solution
We will be using Python and Pygame to create a Space
Invaders style game in which we will present the user with facts about Sea levels rising in New
Zealand pulled from Python Apiâ€™s released by the NZ Government or we will web scrape Statistics NZ
for this data.
This game will be an Arcade style game in which the screen scrolls down like Space Invaders, where
users must perform tasks to prevent sea levels from rising. If they fail to do tasks that prevent global
warming, sea levels will continue to rise, and the game will show a prediction of actual sea levels
rising in New Zealand based on the Govts predictions.
We are going to have a range of data points shown to the player that we interpolate to also show
sea levels rising. This game is meant for children, so it will be fun and interactive, but will also show
the scary truth of how fast global warming is occurring and hopefully influence change in a new
generation of Scientists and Engineers.
There will be a focus on realism regarding the facts that are shown, to mitigate the effects of fake facts being shown to children online.
